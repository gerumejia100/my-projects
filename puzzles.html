            <h2>Puzzles</h2>
            <p>1. The Monty Hall Problem
Imagine you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car, and behind the other two are goats. You pick a door, say #1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say #3, which has a goat. He then asks you, "Do you want to stick with your original choice, door #1, or switch to door #2?" What should you do?

2. The Party Problem
How many people must be at a party to guarantee that there are at least two people who know each other and at least two people who don't know each other? Assume that if person A knows person B, then person B knows person A.

3. The 43 Nuggets Problem
A fast-food restaurant sells chicken nuggets in boxes of 6, 9, and 20. What is the largest number of nuggets you cannot buy? (This is an example of the Frobenius Coin Problem).

4. The 100 Prisoners and a Light Switch
100 prisoners are in a room, and a warden proposes a challenge. He will put them in separate cells. In the middle of the courtyard is a room with a single light switch, which is initially off. Every day, the warden will randomly select one prisoner and send them to the light switch room. The prisoner can flip the switch or not. The prisoners can't communicate with each other except through this light switch. Their goal is to have one prisoner announce, at some point, that all 100 prisoners have visited the room at least once. If the announcement is correct, they are all freed. If it's wrong, they are all executed. What is a strategy that guarantees their freedom?

5. The Bridge and Torch Problem
Four people need to cross a rickety bridge. It's dark, and they only have one torch. The bridge can only hold two people at a time. The people have different crossing times: 1, 2, 5, and 8 minutes. When two people cross, they must walk at the slower person's pace. How can all four people get across in the minimum amount of time, and what is that time?

6. The Three Mugs Problem
You have a full 8-liter jug of water and two empty jugs, one that holds 5 liters and one that holds 3 liters. How can you measure out exactly 4 liters of water using only these three jugs?

7. The Birthday Problem
What is the minimum number of people that need to be in a room for there to be a greater than 50% chance that at least two of them share the same birthday (day and month)?

8. The Missing Dollar
Three friends go to a hotel and are charged $30 for a room. They each pay $10. The manager realizes he overcharged them and tells a bellboy to return $5 to the friends. The bellboy, being greedy, keeps $2 for himself and gives the friends only $3 back, so they each get $1. Now, each friend has paid $9, for a total of $27. The bellboy has $2. That's $27 + $2 = $29. Where is the missing dollar?

9. The Chessboard and Dominoes
A standard 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares. If you remove two diagonally opposite corner squares, is it possible to cover the remaining 62 squares with 31 dominoes, where each domino covers exactly two adjacent squares?

10. The River Crossing Problem
A farmer needs to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of grain across a river. He has a boat that can only carry himself and one other item at a time. If left unsupervised, the fox will eat the chicken, and the chicken will eat the grain. How does he get everything across safely?

11. The Sudoku Puzzle
Fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

12. The Josephus Problem
N people are standing in a circle, and a counting process starts at a designated person. Every Kth person is eliminated. The process continues with the smaller circle of people until only one person remains. Who is the survivor?

13. The Two Fuses Problem
You have two fuses that each burn for exactly one hour. The fuses are not uniform in thickness, so they don't burn at a constant rate. How can you use these two fuses to measure a time of exactly 45 minutes?

14. The Counterfeit Coin
You have 12 coins, one of which is a different weight than the others. It could be either heavier or lighter. You also have a balance scale. What is the minimum number of weighings needed to find the counterfeit coin and determine if it's heavier or lighter?

15. The Snail in the Well
A snail is at the bottom of a 30-foot well. Every day, it climbs up 3 feet but slips back 2 feet at night. How many days does it take for the snail to get out of the well?

16. The Mislabeled Jars
You have three jars. One contains apples, one contains oranges, and the third contains a mix of both. All three jars are mislabeled. You can only take out and look at one piece of fruit from one jar. How can you correctly label all three jars?

17. The Chicken McNuggets Problem (variant of #3)
What is the largest number of McNuggets you cannot buy if they are available in boxes of 6, 9, and 20?

18. The Locker Problem
There are 100 lockers, all closed. 100 students walk by. The first student opens every locker. The second student closes every second locker (2, 4, 6, etc.). The third student changes the state of every third locker (if it's open, they close it; if it's closed, they open it). This continues until the 100th student changes the state of the 100th locker. Which lockers are open at the end?

19. The Handshake Problem
There is a party with an unknown number of people. Everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once. If there were a total of 15 handshakes, how many people were at the party?
